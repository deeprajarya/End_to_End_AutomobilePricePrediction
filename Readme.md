# Automobile's Price Prediction using ML

This project focuses on predicting automobile prices using data analysis and machine learning techniques. It involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing data, selecting relevant features, building regression models, and making accurate price predictions.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform EDA on an automobile dataset.
   - Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data exploration.
   - Visualize feature distributions and relationships among variables.

2. **Feature Selection and Correlation Analysis:**
   - Identify potential predictor variables for automobile prices.
   - Analyze correlations between numerical features and the target variable (price).

3. **Model Development and Selection:**
   - Build regression models to predict automobile prices, including linear, multiple linear, and polynomial regression.
   - Evaluate model performance using R-squared values and select the most accurate model.

4. **Price Prediction and Visualization:**
   - Apply the chosen model to make precise automobile price predictions.
   - Create visualizations to illustrate model outcomes, demonstrating proficiency in machine learning and data-driven decision-making.

## Project Files
